  <summary> [abstract] </summary>
    <p>
      We give an algebraic characterisation of first-order logic with the neighbour relation, on finite words. For this, we consider languages of finite words over alphabets with an involution on them. The natural algebras for such languages are involution semigroups. To characterise the logic, we define a special kind of semidirect product of involution semigroups, called the locally hermitian product. The characterisation theorem for FO with neighbour states that a language is definable in the logic if and only if it is recognised by a locally hermitian product of an aperiodic commutative involution semigroup, and a locally trivial involution semigroup. We then define the notion of involution varieties of languages, namely classes of languages closed under Boolean operations, quotients, involution, and inverse images of involutory morphisms. An Eilenberg-type correspondence is established between involution varieties of languages and pseudovarieties of involution semigroups.

      The notion Universal automaton has been studied since the last 50 years. Though complex and large it has many interesting properties and is worth a more careful look. Our goal is to study this automaton in an algebraic perspective.

**Commutative Algebra**<br><i>Summer internship 2018 with Prof. [R. Sridharan](https://www.cmi.ac.in/people/fac-profile.php?id=rsridhar)</i><br>
This was a reading project in which I studied the fundamentals of Commutative algebra from classic texts by Zariski and Samuel as well as Nathan Jacobson on the subject.

### Course projects

**Advanced Timed automata**<br>*under Prof. [B Srivathsan](https://www.cmi.ac.in/~sri/)*<br>


**On Weakening Strategies for PB solvers**<br>*Automated reasoning under Prof. [Ashutosh Gupta, IITB](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~akg/)*<br>
Involved investigation of weakening, division and resolution strategies and their interplay to minimize constraint blow-up and optimize strength for PB specifications. It further provides an implementation in SAT4j with a case-by-case analysis of observed improvement in runtime.

**Perturbed timed automata**<br>*Timed automata under Prof. [B Srivathsan](https://www.cmi.ac.in/~sri/)*<br>
Determinizability of one clock perturbed timed automata unlike non - perturbed. Gives a construction for the same extending to timed language inclusion decidability hence answering the problem of universality.

**Invariant Model Checking by K-Induction**<br>*Model checking and software verification under Prof. [Mandayam Srivas](https://www.cmi.ac.in/~mksrivas/)*<br>
Implementation of invariant model checking algorithm by k-induction in z3.
