I am a first year post graduate at the [Chennai Mathematical Insitute, Chennai](http://www.cmi.ac.in/) in [Computer Science](https://www.cmi.ac.in/teaching/courses.php?prog=msccs). I graduated in Mathematics and Computer Science from the same institute.

My research interests mainly include logic, algebra and automata theory.
I am particularly interested in language theory, semigroup theory, automata theory including quantitative topics like weighted and timed automata, monadic second-order logic, type theory, proof theory and model checking.
<br/>
Recently I have been learning about formal verification of cryptographic protocols!
<!-- Recently I have also become fond of learning language theory and automata in a categorical perspective. -->

I am fortunate to be an intern in LIS, Marseille (virtual), currently working under the guidance of Prof. [Benjamin Monmege](https://pageperso.lif.univ-mrs.fr/~benjamin.monmege/).

I am also doing a Master's thesis under the supervision of Prof. [S Akshay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~akshayss/) from IIT, Bombay.
